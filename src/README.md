# Armada C library

This directory contains the library's source files and internal headers.

Before looking at these files, take a look at [example 1](/examples/example1/main.c)
If it's your first time, I would suggest looking at the files in the following order:

1. logger
2. arm_motor_api
3. arm_motor
4. claw (You can see right now that claw calibration and hall effect do not exist because they are not connected/implemented in FPGA)
5. kinematic_engine
6. arm

Enjoy :)
